3D printing is a process for making a physical object from a three-dimensional digital model. This is typically done by laying down many successive thin layers of a material, also known as additive manufacturing.

The type of 3D printing shown in the above YouTube video is called fused deposition modelling (FDM), and build objects layer by layer from the bottom up. They do this by heating plastic filament and extruding it through a small nozzle onto a build plate. FDM is arguably the most popular type of 3D printing and is most often used by hobbyists and other non-commercial enthusiasts.
